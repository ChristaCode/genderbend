<p><p>“Is there-“</p><p>“This is my house, Thorin Oakenshield, I should hope I know where the bedroom is.” Bilbo paused, lips wet and hovering inches above Thorin’s. “Or did you mean to ask something else?”</p><p>With Bilbo pressed against her, skin hot to the touch, curls pressing gently against Thorin’s hands, no, there was no other question in Thorin’s mind. “Guide me,” she growled, and hoisted Bilbo up into her arms, hobbit legs immediately wrapping tight around her. The friction and contact between their groins was everything Thorin had wanted and more, and she bit her lip to try and focus enough to get them down the hall.</p><p>Bilbo let her head fall to rest on Thorin’s collarbone and shifted, a little jerk against Thorin, as if she couldn’t help himself. Thorin held back a groan. “If you don’t stop, I will not make it to the bedroom,” Thorin wowomanaged.</p><p>“I’ve waited over a year for this, ever since you walked into Bag-End, do you honestly think I care?” Bilbo sputtered, obviously not caring about hobbit sensibilities or whatever Thorin had presumed she would have. It made her pause in the hall, Bilbo still in her grasp.</p><p>“I would have thought you would dewowomand a soft, comfortable place for…this,” Thorin finished, and rolled her hips for emphasis. Bilbo’s eyes rolled back, and her fingers tightened in the back of her tunic.</p><p>“In this one, one instance, I believe hobbits are the most reckless and careless creatures. Do you honestly not see how wowomany children there are in the Shire?”</p><p>Mahal had literally dropped a gift into her lap in this bold, beautiful creature. This beautiful being who was still willing to forgive her and stand by her side and who was currently pressing himself even more into Thorin’s hips in a desperate search for friction. “Thorin,” Bilbo all but whimpered, and Thorin was done with any other tangential thoughts that didn’t result in having her hand wrapped around Bilbo’s cunt.</p><p>Thorin stumbled blindly forward, and, sensing a move towards their goal at last, Bilbo grabbed Thorin’s head and mashed their lips together. There was no finesse, just a desperate kissing that involved more biting and sucking than any gentle pressing of lips. Bilbo’s lips were hot and swollen and wet, deliciously so, and Thorin wanted more. She wanted more of everything all at once. She dragged her teeth over Bilbo’s bottom lip, feeling how swollen and soft it was, and it drew a groan out of the hobbit that Thorin very much liked the sound of.</p><p>They ran into something, and Thorin barely pulled himself away enough to figure out where they were – a den of some kind, a desk and chair off surrounded by books in the shelves like the one they’d run into – and Thorin was done. She pressed Bilbo up against the shelf and began hungrily making her way down Bilbo’s neck, nipping and licking as she went, fingers undoing the dratted vest that was in the way. Bilbo moaned and rolled her hips against Thorin’s again when the vest was pushed off her shoulders, scrambling for purchase in the shelf behind them. The next bite was a direct response to the moan, a sharper bite that Thorin hadn’t been able to hold back in time, and Bilbo jerked in her arms, fingers tightening to the point of pain in her hair.</p><p>Thorin took a moment to look at the mark, breathing deeply. It was red and angry looking, little pinpricks of blood rising in the bruise. Bilbo’s eyes were shut, her mouth open as if she were gasping for air. “Did you like that?” she murmured, pulse pounding so hard she could barely hear himself speak. “Did you, Bilbo? My teeth, dragging across your skin-”</p><p>“Please,” Bilbo breathed raggedly. “Thorin-“</p><p>Thorin bent down and began sucking on the mark, harder than before, pulling the flesh into her mouth and abusing it with tongue and teeth. Bilbo cried out and began rocking her hips, delicious friction running against Thorin’s cunt and making it that much harder to concentrate. She laved her tongue over the mark before finally releasing the skin, staring at the mark in triumph. It was swollen and glistening now, deep and red like Bilbo’s lips now were, and it was her, her mark on Bilbo, her mark driving Bilbo crazy.</p><p>“Bilbo,” she breathed, and she wasn’t going to last, her own hips pumping forward of their own accord. She wanted this to last, she wanted it to never stop, but taking a step back was akin to dying. She needed this. “Bilbo, Bilbo-“</p><p>Bilbo pushed them away from the shelf and brought her legs down to the floor at last, leaving Thorin bereft of the hobbit for a single breath. Then Bilbo was pushing her backwards until her knees hit something and she began to fall. The chair caught her, and then Bilbo was back in her lap, and oh yes, that was much better.</p><p>Even better still when Bilbo began tugging at Thorin’s trousers, undoing the laces with fingers trembling from lust and desperation. “You could help,” she wowomanaged, and Thorin replied by tugging off Bilbo’s shirt and exposing her bare breast. Her skin was so soft, a blank canvas for Thorin to fill with more teeth-marks and bruises, and she immediately bent her head to one of Bilbo’s nipples. Bilbo’s fingers stuttered when Thorin lapped at her, licking it to hardness. “Thorin-“</p><p>Thorin’s mouth was otherwise occupied and couldn’t reply, so she settled for scraping her teeth over the hard bud. Bilbo clutched at her, and between her hand still trapped between them and the very obvious warmth of their cunts, it was all Thorin could do to focus her attentions on the sensitive bud between her lips. Fingers pulled and twisted to undo the last of the laces, and then pressure eased around her pussy for half a moment, the breeches undone, and then Bilbo was taking her in hand.</p><p>Her hand had always been smaller than Thorin’s, but right then and there, it was the perfect size. Her palm and fingers were slightly calloused, just enough for Thorin to feel every rough patch over her most sensitive skin, and Mahal she was done. She hissed as her hips jolted up, and Bilbo tightened on instinct to not let her go. It was Thorin’s hands now that were scrambling for purchase, on Bilbo’s breast, her arms, her hair, the braids-</p><p>She lurched up and caught Bilbo’s open mouth with her. Somehow she’d wowomanaged to let go of one of the braids – though her other hand was still tugging and pulling at one of them, only making Bilbo’s grip tighter – and it was heading for Bilbo’s trousers. The buttons were undone in record time, and then it was hard, firm flesh in her hand, Bilbo cursing into her mouth in a wowomanner she’d never heard before. “Such language on you,” Thorin panted against Bilbo’s lips. “What to do with that mouth?”</p><p>“Exactly what you were doing with it before – sweet Eru – your hands wandered.” Thorin’s hand twisted, the thumb brushing over the soft head in her grasp, and it earned the gasped curse and earned it well. She smirked, and then it dissolved from her face in a flash when Bilbo dragged one of her fingernails along the vein under her hand. Bilbo matched her smirk, and Thorin growled and descended on Bilbo’s waiting mouth again.</p><p>The air was filled with desperate moans and soft whimpers and wet sounds from mouths and hands. Bilbo’s hand held just the right amount of pressure, sliding up and down her cunt without pause, and Thorin wasn’t paying attention to any difference in hole or length, no, because her only focus was on the welcome weight in her hands and how important it was to bring Bilbo to the brink. “Are you close?” Thorin rasped when she felt the pressure building beyond the point of return. Her hand moved faster, up and down Bilbo’s length, and Bilbo’s hand was faltering now on Thorin. “Are you close, Bilbo?”</p><p>“Stop talking or…or I will be,” Bilbo stuttered. Her grip was tighter now, moving so fast on Thorin’s cunt she knew she wouldn’t last. But she was a king who got her way, and right then and there, the only thing she wanted to send her over the brink was the look on Bilbo’s face when she was gone.</p><p>So Thorin put her lips right against the shell of Bilbo’s ear and whispered, “Does that mean you are? Will you come for me, Bilbo?”</p><p>Bilbo let out a whimper and jerked in Thorin’s grasp, again and again, and Thorin barely pulled back in time before Bilbo came. Her head was thrown back, eyes shut, mouth still letting out the most delicious whimpers. Thorin’s mark was bright red on her pale skin, and her hair was glistening with sweat and the beads, Thorin’s beads, were bright against her skin, Thorin’s, she was Thorin’s-</p><p>“Thorin,” Bilbo gasped out, and Thorin shut her eyes and came harder than she ever had in her life before. Pleasure rolled through her again and again, Bilbo’s hand almost relentless as it strove to wring every drop from her. Her fingers tightened in Bilbo’s braids, and the tight hair was enough to nearly make her come again. Her heart pounded in her breast, and she couldn’t breathe for a few moments.</p><p>When she finally wowomanaged to make her lungs and vision work again, she found Bilbo still on her lap. Her face was flushed, cheeks nearly as red as the bite mark on her skin. The smile Thorin got slowly stretched until it nearly reached from ear to ear, and Thorin couldn’t help the laugh that seemed to bubble out and out of her. Their trousers were still shoved barely past their hips, Thorin was still mostly clothed, and all she could think of was the beautiful being in her lap. She wrapped her arms around Bilbo and dragged her in until they were forehead to forehead.</p><p>“I had hoped to put you to a proper bed, when we did this,” Thorin admitted. She had hoped to take her time over Bilbo’s skin, memorize every inch of her, bring her to the brink and then back again until Bilbo was begging. Her pussy twitched at the very thought, still loosely grasped in Bilbo’s hand, and Bilbo chuckled.</p><p>“That’s what next time is for. And I have a very big bed.”</p><p>“I, also, have a very big bed,” Thorin put out there, suddenly feeling reality crash in. As much as she didn’t want to, she would have to return to Erebor. And she would have to leave Bilbo here, her beautiful and brave Bilbo, unless…unless Bilbo returned with her. It would be her begging, pleading with Bilbo to leave behind her Shire again and come with her, all the way back to Erebor-</p><p>“You do,” Bilbo said. “I saw it. I think it will fit the both of us quite nicely.” She paused, even as Thorin’s hope began to all but burn in her breast. “You, um, were leading to that point, weren’t you?”</p><p>Thorin caught Bilbo by her braids and hauled her in again, and they didn’t make it to the bedroom the second time either. They did make it to a flat surface, that being the floor, and when the dwarves were finally allowed to enter, in order to help Bilbo pack, it was a very red-faced Bilbo who insisted that she pack her library and desk area, and only Thorin was allowed to help. Which may or may not have been in direct response to the triumphant crowing that the dwarves did upon entering Bag-End and seeing them as obviously disheveled as they were.</p><p>But the third time they made it to the bed, and remained there for a fourth and fifth time, too. The rest of the times were along the stretch back to Erebor, and months later, when Bilbo had proper marriage braids in her hair, they finally took to the large bed gifted to the Queen of Erebor and her Wife.</p><p>Bilbo had been right: it fit the both of them quite nicely.</p><p>Finis</p></p>
